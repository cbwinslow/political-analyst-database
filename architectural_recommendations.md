Architectural Recommendations for the Political Intelligence Platform (V2)This document addresses the next major phase of development, focusing on establishing a robust database foundation and a comprehensive, production-ready service architecture.1. The Core Challenge: Managing ComplexityYou have curated an exceptional list of best-in-class, open-source tools. This is the right toolkit for a project of this scale. The primary architectural challenge is not a lack of capability, but managing the complexity and redundancy that comes with deploying so many powerful systems.Our strategy will be to organize these services into a coherent, microservices-based stack, ensuring each component has a clear, non-overlapping role. We will focus on creating a "V1 Core Stack" that is powerful, manageable, and forms a solid foundation for future expansion.2. Supabase - A Clarification on Self-HostingYour desire to use all of Supabase's features is understandableâ€”it's a fantastic platform. However, as your own proposal document wisely pointed out, self-hosting the entire Supabase monolith is a significant operational burden.Recommendation: Continue with the "Decoupled" Approach.Instead of deploying the full, multi-container Supabase stack, we will implement its core functionalities using dedicated, best-in-class services that you've already selected:Database: A standalone, powerful PostgreSQL instance.Authentication & API: Handled by your FastAPI backend and managed via the Kong API gateway. This is more flexible and powerful than Supabase's built-in tools.Edge Functions: These can be implemented as lightweight, serverless functions or as separate microservices in your stack, giving you more language and runtime flexibility.Storage: A dedicated S3-compatible object store like MinIO (which we can add).This approach gives you all the power of Supabase without the operational complexity and "black box" nature of its self-hosted version.3. The Grand Stack: A Coherent V1 Core ArchitectureLet's organize your extensive list into functional groups and define a core V1 stack.API Gateway:Kong: Perfect choice. It will be the single, secure entry point for all API traffic to your frontend and other clients.Orchestration & Agent Frameworks:Orchestrator: n8n. Your primary tool for defining and running the high-level data ingestion and processing workflows.Agent Logic: LangGraph. For coding the complex, cyclical logic of your AI agent teams (e.g., debates, analysis loops).Visual Agent Builder: Flowise. A great tool for rapid prototyping and building simpler, chain-based agents visually. It complements n8n and LangGraph.AI Inference & UI:Inference Engines: LocalAI and Ollama. Running both gives you flexibility. You can serve different models on each or use one as a fallback.Web UI: OpenWebUI. Essential for interacting with your local models.Data Persistence & Knowledge:Relational & Vector DB: PostgreSQL + pgvector. This will be our starting point for relational data and initial vector search capabilities.High-Performance Vector DB: Qdrant. The V1 stack will include Qdrant, preparing for the migration from pgvector as data scales.Graph DB: Neo4j. The heart of the knowledge graph, with all its plugins.Search & Analytics: OpenSearch. While Qdrant/pgvector handle semantic search, OpenSearch is invaluable for full-text search, log analysis, and building rich analytical dashboards.Observability & Monitoring:Metrics: Prometheus (for scraping metrics) & Grafana (for visualization). This is the industry-standard combo.System Monitoring: Netdata. Provides real-time, granular performance monitoring of all your containers.Log Management: Fluentd (for log collection) & Graylog (for aggregation and analysis).AI Tracing: Langfuse. Critical for debugging your LangGraph agents.Error Tracking: Sentry. For application-level error monitoring in your Python and Next.js code.Asynchronous Tasks & Messaging:RabbitMQ: A robust message broker. Your services (e.g., Crawler) can publish messages to a queue, and worker agents can consume them asynchronously. This decouples your services and improves reliability.Supporting Tools:AnythingLLM / LocalRAG: These are excellent for building self-contained RAG applications. They can be included as reference services.SearXNG: A fantastic, privacy-respecting meta-search engine. An agent could use this as a tool for real-time web lookups.Note on Pigsty.io: Pigsty is an incredible, production-grade PostgreSQL distribution. For this Docker-based, multi-service environment, we will draw inspiration from its best practices but stick to official container images with custom SQL initialization scripts. This provides better integration with the other services in the docker-compose ecosystem.4. Networking: ZeroTier and CloudflareYour plan to connect to a central Ubuntu server via ZeroTier and expose services through Cloudflare is a modern and secure approach.ZeroTier: Creates a secure, private network layer for your services. Your containers can communicate with each other over this network as if they were on a local LAN.Cloudflare Tunnels: A secure way to expose your primary service (the Kong API Gateway) to the public internet without opening firewall ports on your server.This setup is perfect for both development and production.I will now provide the code artifacts to bring this V2 architecture to life.
