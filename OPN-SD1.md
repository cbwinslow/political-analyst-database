# **MCP Server: Architecture and Design for Political Document Ingestion**

## **1\. Conceptual Overview**

Your vision for an "MCP Server" that intelligently crawls, ingests, and analyzes political documents is a powerful one. While the term "MCP" might evoke the Master Control Program from "Tron," in the context of modern AI, it can be thought of as a **Multi-agent Control Platform**. This platform will orchestrate a team of specialized AI agents to achieve your data collection and analysis goals.  
At its core, this system will automate the process of finding, understanding, and preparing political documents for further use, whether that's in-depth analysis, database storage, or as fodder for other applications.

## **2\. System Architecture**

A robust MCP server for this task can be broken down into several key modules:

### **2.1. The Crawling and Scraping Module**

This module is responsible for systematically browsing your target websites and identifying relevant documents.

* **Target List:** You'll maintain a prioritized list of websites to crawl, including .gov domains, specific subdomains, and specialized sites like WikiLeaks. This list should be easily updatable.  
* **Politeness Policy:** To avoid being blocked and to respect website owners, your crawlers must adhere to robots.txt files and implement rate limiting to avoid overwhelming servers.  
* **Document Identification:** The crawlers will be programmed to identify links to documents based on file extensions (.pdf, .docx, .txt, etc.) and specific HTML structures.  
* **Content Extraction:** Once a document is identified, the scraper will download it. For web pages, it will extract the relevant text content, filtering out boilerplate like headers, footers, and ads.

### **2.2. The Document Conversion and Staging Module**

Raw documents come in many formats. This module's job is to create a consistent format for the AI agents to work with.

* **Format Conversion:** Using libraries like pypdf for PDFs and python-docx for Word documents, this module will convert all documents into a standardized format, such as plain text or Markdown.  
* **Staging Area:** Converted documents will be stored in a temporary "staging area," ready for processing by the AI agents. This could be a cloud storage bucket or a dedicated directory on your server.

### **2.3. The AI Agent Core**

This is the heart of your MCP server, where the intelligence of the system resides. You'll have multiple AI agents, each with a specific role.

* **Agent Orchestrator:** This "master" agent assigns tasks to the other agents. For example, it might assign a newly downloaded document to an "Analysis Agent."  
* **Document Analysis Agent:** This agent reads the converted document and performs initial analysis. This could include:  
  * **Summarization:** Creating a concise summary of the document's contents.  
  * **Entity Recognition:** Identifying key people, organizations, and locations mentioned.  
  * **Topic Modeling:** Determining the main themes and topics of the document.  
* **Extraction Agent:** This agent is equipped with tools to extract specific pieces of information from the document, such as dates, policy numbers, or specific legal clauses.  
* **Memory:**  
  * **Short-Term Memory:** This allows an agent to remember the context of its current task. For example, while analyzing a multi-page document, it needs to remember what it read on previous pages.  
  * **Long-Term Memory:** This is a persistent knowledge base that allows agents to learn and improve over time. For example, it could store information about which websites are most likely to contain certain types of documents, or it could remember the relationships between different government agencies.

### **2.4. Ingestion and Output Module**

Once the AI agents have processed a document, this module handles the final steps.

* **Data Formatting:** The processed data (summaries, extracted entities, etc.) is formatted into a structured format like JSON.  
* **Ingestion:** The formatted data is then ingested into your target application, which could be:  
  * A searchable database (like Elasticsearch or a SQL database).  
  * A data visualization tool.  
  * Another AI application for deeper analysis.

## **3\. The Workflow in Action**

1. The **Crawling Module** identifies and downloads a new bill from a congressional website.  
2. The **Document Conversion Module** converts the PDF of the bill into plain text.  
3. The **Agent Orchestrator** assigns the text to a **Document Analysis Agent**.  
4. The **Analysis Agent** reads the text, summarizes the bill's purpose, and identifies the sponsoring representatives. It uses its **short-term memory** to keep track of the different sections of the bill.  
5. The **Orchestrator** then passes the summary and the original text to an **Extraction Agent**.  
6. The **Extraction Agent** is tasked with finding any mention of specific budget allocations. It uses its tools to scan the document for dollar amounts and keywords related to funding.  
7. The **Ingestion and Output Module** takes the summary and the extracted budget information, formats it as a JSON object, and inserts it into a database of legislative documents.  
8. The agents update their **long-term memory**, noting that this particular congressional subcommittee website is a good source for budget-related bills.

This modular architecture allows you to build and scale your MCP server effectively, with each component having a clear and distinct responsibility.
