# This file provides simple, memorable commands to manage the complex
# Docker Compose stack for the Political Intelligence Platform.
#
# Usage:
#   make up         - Start all services in detached mode.
#   make down       - Stop and remove all services and volumes.
#   make logs       - Follow the logs of all services.
#   make logs-agent - Follow the logs of just the agentic-kg service.
#   make rebuild    - Rebuild the images and restart the services.
